Doubtfull it stood,\\nAs two spent Swimmers, that doe cling together,\\nAnd choake their Art: The mercilesse Macdonwald\\n(Worthie to be a Rebell, for to that\\nThe multiplying Villanies of Nature\\nDoe swarme vpon him) from the Westerne Isles\\nOf Kernes and Gallowgrosses is supply'd,\\nAnd Fortune on his damned Quarry smiling,\\nShew'd like a Rebells Whore: but all's too weake:\\nFor braue Macbeth (well hee deserues that Name)\\nDisdayning Fortune, with his brandisht Steele,\\nWhich smoak'd with bloody execution\\n(Like Valours Minion) caru'd out his passage,\\nTill hee fac'd the Slaue:\\nWhich neu'r shooke hands, nor bad farwell to him,\\nTill he vnseam'd him from the Naue toth' Chops,\\nAnd fix'd his Head vpon our Battlements\\n\\n   King.

All haile Macbeth, that shalt be King hereafter\\n\\n   Banq. Good Sir, why doe you start, and seeme to feare\\nThings that doe sound so faire? i'th' name of truth\\nAre ye fantasticall, or that indeed\\nWhich outwardly ye shew? My Noble Partner\\nYou greet with present Grace, and great prediction\\nOf Noble hauing, and of Royall hope,\\nThat he seemes wrapt withall: to me you speake not.\\nIf you can looke into the Seedes of Time,\\nAnd say, which Graine will grow, and which will not,\\nSpeake then to me, who neyther begge, nor feare\\nYour fauors, nor your hate\\n\\n   1.

Say from whence\\nYou owe this strange Intelligence, or why\\nVpon this blasted Heath you stop our way\\nWith such Prophetique greeting?\\nSpeake, I charge you.\\n\\nWitches vanish.\\n\\n  Banq. The Earth hath bubbles, as the Water ha's,\\nAnd these are of them: whither are they vanish'd?\\n  Macb. Into the Ayre: and what seem'd corporall,\\nMelted, as breath into the Winde.\\nWould they had stay'd\\n\\n   Banq. Were such things here, as we doe speake about?\\nOr haue we eaten on the insane Root,\\nThat takes the Reason Prisoner?\\n  Macb. Your Children shall be Kings\\n\\n   Banq. You shall be King\\n\\n   Macb. And Thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?\\n  Banq. Toth' selfe-same tune and words: who's here?\\nEnter Rosse and Angus.\\n\\n  Rosse. The King hath happily receiu'd, Macbeth,\\nThe newes of thy successe: and when he reades\\nThy personall Venture in the Rebels sight,\\nHis Wonders and his Prayses doe contend,\\nWhich should be thine, or his: silenc'd with that,\\nIn viewing o're the rest o'th' selfe-same day,\\nHe findes thee in the stout Norweyan Rankes,\\nNothing afeard of what thy selfe didst make\\nStrange Images of death, as thick as Tale\\nCan post with post, and euery one did beare\\nThy prayses in his Kingdomes great defence,\\nAnd powr'd them downe before him\\n\\n   Ang. Wee are sent,\\nTo giue thee from our Royall Master thanks,\\nOnely to harrold thee into his sight,\\nNot pay thee\\n\\n   Rosse. And for an earnest of a greater Honor,\\nHe bad me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor:\\nIn which addition, haile most worthy Thane,\\nFor it is thine\\n\\n   Banq. What, can the Deuill speake true?\\n  Macb. The Thane of Cawdor liues:\\nWhy doe you dresse me in borrowed Robes?\\n  Ang. Who was the Thane, liues yet,\\nBut vnder heauie Iudgement beares that Life,\\nWhich he deserues to loose.\\nWhether he was combin'd with those of Norway,\\nOr did lyne the Rebell with hidden helpe,\\nAnd vantage; or that with both he labour'd\\nIn his Countreyes wracke, I know not:\\nBut Treasons Capitall, confess'd, and prou'd,\\nHaue ouerthrowne him\\n\\n   Macb. Glamys, and Thane of Cawdor:\\nThe greatest is behinde. Thankes for your paines.\\nDoe you not hope your Children shall be Kings,\\nWhen those that gaue the Thane of Cawdor to me,\\nPromis'd no lesse to them\\n\\n   Banq. That trusted home,\\nMight yet enkindle you vnto the Crowne,\\nBesides the Thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:\\nAnd oftentimes, to winne vs to our harme,\\nThe Instruments of Darknesse tell vs Truths,\\nWinne vs with honest Trifles, to betray's\\nIn deepest consequence.\\nCousins, a word, I pray you\\n\\n   Macb. Two Truths are told,\\nAs happy Prologues to the swelling Act\\nOf the Imperiall Theame. I thanke you Gentlemen:\\nThis supernaturall solliciting\\nCannot be ill; cannot be good.\\nIf ill? why hath it giuen me earnest of successe,\\nCommencing in a Truth? I am Thane of Cawdor.\\nIf good? why doe I yeeld to that suggestion,\\nWhose horrid Image doth vnfixe my Heire,\\nAnd make my seated Heart knock at my Ribbes,\\nAgainst the vse of Nature? Present Feares\\nAre lesse then horrible Imaginings:\\nMy Thought, whose Murther yet is but fantasticall,\\nShakes so my single state of Man,\\nThat Function is smother'd in surmise,\\nAnd nothing is, but what is not\\n\\n   Banq. Looke how our Partner's rapt\\n\\n   Macb. If Chance will haue me King,\\nWhy Chance may Crowne me,\\nWithout my stirre\\n\\n   Banq. New Honors come vpon him\\nLike our strange Garments, cleaue not to their mould,\\nBut with the aid of vse\\n\\n   Macb. Come what come may,\\nTime, and the Houre, runs through the roughest Day\\n\\n   Banq. Worthy Macbeth, wee stay vpon your leysure\\n\\n   Macb. Giue me your fauour:\\nMy dull Braine was wrought with things forgotten.\\nKinde Gentlemen, your paines are registred,\\nWhere euery day I turne the Leafe,\\nTo reade them.\\nLet vs toward the King: thinke vpon\\nWhat hath chanc'd: and at more time,\\nThe Interim hauing weigh'd it, let vs speake\\nOur free Hearts each to other\\n\\n   Banq.

Is execution done on Cawdor?\\nOr not those in Commission yet return'd?\\n  Mal. My Liege, they are not yet come back.\\nBut I haue spoke with one that saw him die:\\nWho did report, that very frankly hee\\nConfess'd his Treasons, implor'd your Highnesse Pardon,\\nAnd set forth a deepe Repentance:\\nNothing in his Life became him,\\nLike the leauing it. Hee dy'de,\\nAs one that had beene studied in his death,\\nTo throw away the dearest thing he ow'd,\\nAs 'twere a carelesse Trifle\\n\\n   King. There's no Art,\\nTo finde the Mindes construction in the Face.\\nHe was a Gentleman, on whom I built\\nAn absolute Trust.\\nEnter Macbeth, Banquo, Rosse, and Angus.\\n\\nO worthyest Cousin,\\nThe sinne of my Ingratitude euen now\\nWas heauie on me. Thou art so farre before,\\nThat swiftest Wing of Recompence is slow,\\nTo ouertake thee. Would thou hadst lesse deseru'd,\\nThat the proportion both of thanks, and payment,\\nMight haue beene mine: onely I haue left to say,\\nMore is thy due, then more then all can pay\\n\\n   Macb. The seruice, and the loyaltie I owe,\\nIn doing it, payes it selfe.\\nYour Highnesse part, is to receiue our Duties:\\nAnd our Duties are to your Throne, and State,\\nChildren, and Seruants; which doe but what they should,\\nBy doing euery thing safe toward your Loue\\nAnd Honor\\n\\n   King. Welcome hither:\\nI haue begun to plant thee, and will labour\\nTo make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,\\nThat hast no lesse deseru'd, nor must be knowne\\nNo lesse to haue done so: Let me enfold thee,\\nAnd hold thee to my Heart\\n\\n   Banq.

Sonnes, Kinsmen, Thanes,\\nAnd you whose places are the nearest, know,\\nWe will establish our Estate vpon\\nOur eldest, Malcolme, whom we name hereafter,\\nThe Prince of Cumberland: which Honor must\\nNot vnaccompanied, inuest him onely,\\nBut signes of Noblenesse, like Starres, shall shine\\nOn all deseruers. From hence to Envernes,\\nAnd binde vs further to you\\n\\n   Macb. The Rest is Labor, which is not vs'd for you:\\nIle be my selfe the Herbenger, and make ioyfull\\nThe hearing of my Wife, with your approach:\\nSo humbly take my leaue\\n\\n   King. My worthy Cawdor\\n\\n   Macb. The Prince of Cumberland: that is a step,\\nOn which I must fall downe, or else o're-leape,\\nFor in my way it lyes.

They met me in the day of successe: and I haue\\nlearn'd by the perfect'st report, they haue more in them, then\\nmortall knowledge. When I burnt in desire to question them\\nfurther, they made themselues Ayre, into which they vanish'd.\\nWhiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came Missiues from\\nthe King, who all-hail'd me Thane of Cawdor, by which Title\\nbefore, these weyward Sisters saluted me, and referr'd me to\\nthe comming on of time, with haile King that shalt be. This\\nhaue I thought good to deliuer thee (my dearest Partner of\\nGreatnesse) that thou might'st not loose the dues of reioycing\\nby being ignorant of what Greatnesse is promis'd thee. Lay\\nit to thy heart and farewell.\\nGlamys thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be\\nWhat thou art promis'd: yet doe I feare thy Nature,\\nIt is too full o'th' Milke of humane kindnesse,\\nTo catch the neerest way. Thou would'st be great,\\nArt not without Ambition, but without\\nThe illnesse should attend it. What thou would'st highly,\\nThat would'st thou holily: would'st not play false,\\nAnd yet would'st wrongly winne.\\nThould'st haue, great Glamys, that which cryes,\\nThus thou must doe, if thou haue it;\\nAnd that which rather thou do'st feare to doe,\\nThen wishest should be vndone. High thee hither,\\nThat I may powre my Spirits in thine Eare,\\nAnd chastise with the valour of my Tongue\\nAll that impeides thee from the Golden Round,\\nWhich Fate and Metaphysicall ayde doth seeme\\nTo haue thee crown'd withall.\\nEnter Messenger.\\n\\nWhat is your tidings?\\n  Mess.

Come to my Womans Brests,\\nAnd take my Milke for Gall, you murth'ring Ministers,\\nWhere-euer, in your sightlesse substances,\\nYou wait on Natures Mischiefe.

We will proceed no further in this Businesse:\\nHe hath Honour'd me of late, and I haue bought\\nGolden Opinions from all sorts of people,\\nWhich would be worne now in their newest glosse,\\nNot cast aside so soone\\n\\n   La. Was the hope drunke,\\nWherein you drest your selfe? Hath it slept since?\\nAnd wakes it now to looke so greene, and pale,\\nAt what it did so freely? From this time,\\nSuch I account thy loue. Art thou affear'd\\nTo be the same in thine owne Act, and Valour,\\nAs thou art in desire? Would'st thou haue that\\nWhich thou esteem'st the Ornament of Life,\\nAnd liue a Coward in thine owne Esteeme?\\nLetting I dare not, wait vpon I would,\\nLike the poore Cat i'th' Addage\\n\\n   Macb. Prythee peace:\\nI dare do all that may become a man,\\nWho dares do more, is none\\n\\n   La.

I dare not speake much further,\\nBut cruell are the times, when we are Traitors\\nAnd do not know our selues: when we hold Rumor\\nFrom what we feare, yet know not what we feare,\\nBut floate vpon a wilde and violent Sea\\nEach way, and moue.

Why one that sweares, and lyes\\n\\n   Son. And be all Traitors, that do so\\n\\n   Wife. Euery one that do's so, is a Traitor,\\nAnd must be hang'd\\n\\n   Son. And must they all be hang'd, that swear and lye?\\n  Wife. Euery one\\n\\n   Son. Who must hang them?\\n  Wife. Why, the honest men\\n\\n   Son.

Whether should I flye?\\nI haue done no harme. But I remember now\\nI am in this earthly world: where to do harme\\nIs often laudable, to do good sometime\\nAccounted dangerous folly.

But Macbeth is.\\nA good and vertuous Nature may recoyle\\nIn an Imperiall charge. But I shall craue your pardon:\\nThat which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose;\\nAngels are bright still, though the brightest fell.\\nThough all things foule, would wear the brows of grace\\nYet Grace must still looke so\\n\\n   Macd. I haue lost my Hopes\\n\\n   Malc. Perchance euen there\\nWhere I did finde my doubts.\\nWhy in that rawnesse left you Wife, and Childe?\\nThose precious Motiues, those strong knots of Loue,\\nWithout leaue-taking. I pray you,\\nLet not my Iealousies, be your Dishonors,\\nBut mine owne Safeties: you may be rightly iust,\\nWhat euer I shall thinke\\n\\n   Macd. Bleed, bleed poore Country,\\nGreat Tyrrany, lay thou thy basis sure,\\nFor goodnesse dare not check thee: wear y thy wrongs,\\nThe Title, is affear'd. Far thee well Lord,\\nI would not be the Villaine that thou think'st,\\nFor the whole Space that's in the Tyrants Graspe,\\nAnd the rich East to boot\\n\\n   Mal. Be not offended:\\nI speake not as in absolute feare of you:\\nI thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake,\\nIt weepes, it bleeds, and each new day a gash\\nIs added to her wounds. I thinke withall,\\nThere would be hands vplifted in my right:\\nAnd heere from gracious England haue I offer\\nOf goodly thousands. But for all this,\\nWhen I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head,\\nOr weare it on my Sword; yet my poore Country\\nShall haue more vices then it had before,\\nMore suffer, and more sundry wayes then euer,\\nBy him that shall succeede\\n\\n   Macd. What should he be?\\n  Mal. It is my selfe I meane: in whom I know\\nAll the particulars of Vice so grafted,\\nThat when they shall be open'd, blacke Macbeth\\nWill seeme as pure as Snow, and the poore State\\nEsteeme him as a Lambe, being compar'd\\nWith my confinelesse harmes\\n\\n   Macd. Not in the Legions\\nOf horrid Hell, can come a Diuell more damn'd\\nIn euils, to top Macbeth\\n\\n   Mal. I grant him Bloody,\\nLuxurious, Auaricious, False, Deceitfull,\\nSodaine, Malicious, smacking of euery sinne\\nThat ha's a name. But there's no bottome, none\\nIn my Voluptuousnesse: Your Wiues, your Daughters,\\nYour Matrons, and your Maides, could not fill vp\\nThe Cesterne of my Lust, and my Desire\\nAll continent Impediments would ore-beare\\nThat did oppose my will. Better Macbeth,\\nThen such an one to reigne\\n\\n   Macd. Boundlesse intemperance\\nIn Nature is a Tyranny: It hath beene\\nTh' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne,\\nAnd fall of many Kings. But feare not yet\\nTo take vpon you what is yours: you may\\nConuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,\\nAnd yet seeme cold. The time you may so hoodwinke:\\nWe haue willing Dames enough: there cannot be\\nThat Vulture in you, to deuoure so many\\nAs will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues,\\nFinding it so inclinde\\n\\n   Mal. With this, there growes\\nIn my most ill-composd Affection, such\\nA stanchlesse Auarice, that were I King,\\nI should cut off the Nobles for their Lands,\\nDesire his Iewels, and this others House,\\nAnd my more-hauing, would be as a Sawce\\nTo make me hunger more, that I should forge\\nQuarrels vniust against the Good and Loyall,\\nDestroying them for wealth\\n\\n   Macd. This Auarice\\nstickes deeper: growes with more pernicious roote\\nThen Summer-seeming Lust: and it hath bin\\nThe Sword of our slaine Kings: yet do not feare,\\nScotland hath Foysons, to fill vp your will\\nOf your meere Owne. All these are portable,\\nWith other Graces weigh'd\\n\\n   Mal. But I haue none. The King-becoming Graces,\\nAs Iustice, Verity, Temp'rance, Stablenesse,\\nBounty, Perseuerance, Mercy, Lowlinesse,\\nDeuotion, Patience, Courage, Fortitude,\\nI haue no rellish of them, but abound\\nIn the diuision of each seuerall Crime,\\nActing it many wayes. Nay, had I powre, I should\\nPoure the sweet Milke of Concord, into Hell,\\nVprore the vniuersall peace, confound\\nAll vnity on earth\\n\\n   Macd. O Scotland, Scotland\\n\\n   Mal. If such a one be fit to gouerne, speake:\\nI am as I haue spoken\\n\\n   Mac. Fit to gouern? No not to liue. O Natio[n] miserable!\\nWith an vntitled Tyrant, bloody Sceptred,\\nWhen shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe?\\nSince that the truest Issue of thy Throne\\nBy his owne Interdiction stands accust,\\nAnd do's blaspheme his breed? Thy Royall Father\\nWas a most Sainted-King: the Queene that bore thee,\\nOftner vpon her knees, then on her feet,\\nDy'de euery day she liu'd. Fare thee well,\\nThese Euils thou repeat'st vpon thy selfe,\\nHath banish'd me from Scotland. O my Brest,\\nThy hope ends heere\\n\\n   Mal. Macduff, this Noble passion\\nChilde of integrity, hath from my soule\\nWip'd the blacke Scruples, reconcil'd my thoughts\\nTo thy good Truth, and Honor. Diuellish Macbeth,\\nBy many of these traines, hath sought to win me\\nInto his power: and modest Wisedome pluckes me\\nFrom ouer-credulous hast: but God aboue\\nDeale betweene thee and me; For euen now\\nI put my selfe to thy Direction, and\\nVnspeake mine owne detraction. Heere abiure\\nThe taints, and blames I laide vpon my selfe,\\nFor strangers to my Nature. I am yet\\nVnknowne to Woman, neuer was forsworne,\\nScarsely haue coueted what was mine owne.\\nAt no time broke my Faith, would not betray\\nThe Deuill to his Fellow, and delight\\nNo lesse in truth then life. My first false speaking\\nWas this vpon my selfe. What I am truly\\nIs thine, and my poore Countries to command:\\nWhither indeed, before they heere approach\\nOld Seyward with ten thousand warlike men\\nAlready at a point, was setting foorth:\\nNow wee'l together, and the chance of goodnesse\\nBe like our warranted Quarrell. Why are you silent?\\n  Macd. Such welcome, and vnwelcom things at once\\n'Tis hard to reconcile.\\nEnter a Doctor.\\n\\n  Mal. Well, more anon. Comes the King forth\\nI pray you?\\n  Doct.

With this strange vertue,\\nHe hath a heauenly guift of Prophesie,\\nAnd sundry Blessings hang about his Throne,\\nThat speake him full of Grace.\\nEnter Rosse.\\n\\n  Macd.

Good God betimes remoue\\nThe meanes that makes vs Strangers\\n\\n   Rosse. Sir, Amen\\n\\n   Macd. Stands Scotland where it did?\\n  Rosse. Alas poore Countrey,\\nAlmost affraid to know it selfe. It cannot\\nBe call'd our Mother, but our Graue; where nothing\\nBut who knowes nothing, is once seene to smile:\\nWhere sighes, and groanes, and shrieks that rent the ayre\\nAre made, not mark'd: Where violent sorrow seemes\\nA Moderne extasie: The Deadmans knell,\\nIs there scarse ask'd for who, and good mens liues\\nExpire before the Flowers in their Caps,\\nDying, or ere they sicken\\n\\n   Macd. Oh Relation; too nice, and yet too true\\n\\n   Malc. What's the newest griefe?\\n  Rosse. That of an houres age, doth hisse the speaker,\\nEach minute teemes a new one\\n\\n   Macd.

Bee't their comfort\\nWe are comming thither: Gracious England hath\\nLent vs good Seyward, and ten thousand men,\\nAn older, and a better Souldier, none\\nThat Christendome giues out\\n\\n   Rosse. Would I could answer\\nThis comfort with the like. But I haue words\\nThat would be howl'd out in the desert ayre,\\nWhere hearing should not latch them\\n\\n   Macd.

No minde that's honest\\nBut in it shares some woe, though the maine part\\nPertaines to you alone\\n\\n   Macd. If it be mine\\nKeepe it not from me, quickly let me haue it\\n\\n   Rosse.

Your Castle is surpriz'd: your Wife, and Babes\\nSauagely slaughter'd: To relate the manner\\nWere on the Quarry of these murther'd Deere\\nTo adde the death of you\\n\\n   Malc.

The time approaches,\\nThat will with due decision make vs know\\nWhat we shall say we haue, and what we owe:\\nThoughts speculatiue, their vnsure hopes relate,\\nBut certaine issue, stroakes must arbitrate,\\nTowards which, aduance the warre.\\n\\nExeunt. marching\\n\\nScena Quinta.\\n\\nEnter Macbeth, Seyton, & Souldiers, with Drum and Colours.\\n\\n  Macb. Hang out our Banners on the outward walls,\\nThe Cry is still, they come: our Castles strength\\nWill laugh a Siedge to scorne: Heere let them lye,\\nTill Famine and the Ague eate them vp:\\nWere they not forc'd with those that should be ours,\\nWe might haue met them darefull, beard to beard,\\nAnd beate them backward home. What is that noyse?\\n\\nA Cry within of Women.\\n\\n  Sey. It is the cry of women, my good Lord\\n\\n   Macb. I haue almost forgot the taste of Feares:\\nThe time ha's beene, my sences would haue cool'd\\nTo heare a Night-shrieke, and my Fell of haire\\nWould at a dismall Treatise rowze, and stirre\\nAs life were in't. I haue supt full with horrors,\\nDirenesse familiar to my slaughterous thoughts\\nCannot once start me. Wherefore was that cry?\\n  Sey. The Queene (my Lord) is dead\\n\\n   Macb. She should haue dy'de heereafter;\\nThere would haue beene a time for such a word:\\nTo morrow, and to morrow, and to morrow,\\nCreepes in this petty pace from day to day,\\nTo the last Syllable of Recorded time:\\nAnd all our yesterdayes, haue lighted Fooles\\nThe way to dusty death. Out, out, breefe Candle,\\nLife's but a walking Shadow, a poore Player,\\nThat struts and frets his houre vpon the Stage,\\nAnd then is heard no more. It is a Tale\\nTold by an Ideot, full of sound and fury\\nSignifying nothing.\\nEnter a Messenger.\\n\\nThou com'st to vse thy Tongue: thy Story quickly\\n\\n   Mes. Gracious my Lord,\\nI should report that which I say I saw,\\nBut know not how to doo't\\n\\n   Macb. Well, say sir\\n\\n   Mes. As I did stand my watch vpon the Hill\\nI look'd toward Byrnane, and anon me thought\\nThe Wood began to moue\\n\\n   Macb. Lyar, and Slaue\\n\\n   Mes. Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:\\nWithin this three Mile may you see it comming.\\nI say, a mouing Groue\\n\\n   Macb. If thou speak'st false,\\nVpon the next Tree shall thou hang aliue\\nTill Famine cling thee: If thy speech be sooth,\\nI care not if thou dost for me as much.\\nI pull in Resolution, and begin\\nTo doubt th' Equiuocation of the Fiend,\\nThat lies like truth. Feare not, till Byrnane Wood\\nDo come to Dunsinane, and now a Wood\\nComes toward Dunsinane. Arme, Arme, and out,\\nIf this which he auouches, do's appeare,\\nThere is nor flying hence, nor tarrying here.\\nI 'ginne to be a-weary of the Sun,\\nAnd wish th' estate o'th' world were now vndon.\\nRing the Alarum Bell, blow Winde, come wracke,\\nAt least wee'l dye with Harnesse on our backe.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nScena Sexta.\\n\\nDrumme and Colours. Enter Malcolme, Seyward, Macduffe, and\\ntheir Army,\\nwith Boughes.\\n\\n  Mal. Now neere enough:\\nYour leauy Skreenes throw downe,\\nAnd shew like those you are: You (worthy Vnkle)\\nShall with my Cosin your right Noble Sonne\\nLeade our first Battell. Worthy Macduffe, and wee\\nShall take vpon's what else remaines to do,\\nAccording to our order\\n\\n   Sey. Fare you well:\\nDo we but finde the Tyrants power to night,\\nLet vs be beaten, if we cannot fight\\n\\n   Macd. Make all our Trumpets speak, giue the[m] all breath\\nThose clamorous Harbingers of Blood, & Death.\\n\\nExeunt.\\n\\nAlarums continued.\\n\\n\\nScena Septima.\\n\\nEnter Macbeth.\\n\\n  Macb. They haue tied me to a stake, I cannot flye,\\nBut Beare-like I must fight the course. What's he\\nThat was not borne of Woman? Such a one\\nAm I to feare, or none.\\nEnter young Seyward.\\n\\n  Y.Sey. What is thy name?\\n  Macb. Thou'lt be affraid to heare it\\n\\n   Y.Sey. No: though thou call'st thy selfe a hoter name\\nThen any is in hell\\n\\n   Macb. My name's Macbeth\\n\\n   Y.Sey. The diuell himselfe could not pronounce a Title\\nMore hatefull to mine eare\\n\\n   Macb. No: nor more fearefull\\n\\n   Y.Sey. Thou lyest abhorred Tyrant, with my Sword\\nIle proue the lye thou speak'st.\\n\\nFight, and young Seyward slaine.\\n\\n  Macb. Thou was't borne of woman;\\nBut Swords I smile at, Weapons laugh to scorne,\\nBrandish'd by man that's of a Woman borne.\\nEnter.\\n\\nAlarums. Enter Macduffe.\\n\\n  Macd. That way the noise is: Tyrant shew thy face,\\nIf thou beest slaine, and with no stroake of mine,\\nMy Wife and Childrens Ghosts will haunt me still:\\nI cannot strike at wretched Kernes, whose armes\\nAre hyr'd to beare their Staues; either thou Macbeth,\\nOr else my Sword with an vnbattered edge\\nI sheath againe vndeeded. There thou should'st be,\\nBy this great clatter, one of greatest note\\nSeemes bruited. Let me finde him Fortune,\\nAnd more I begge not.\\n\\nExit. Alarums.\\n\\nEnter Malcolme and Seyward.\\n\\n  Sey. This way my Lord, the Castles gently rendred:\\nThe Tyrants people, on both sides do fight,\\nThe Noble Thanes do brauely in the Warre,\\nThe day almost it selfe professes yours,\\nAnd little is to do\\n\\n   Malc. We haue met with Foes\\nThat strike beside vs\\n\\n   Sey. Enter Sir, the Castle.\\n\\nExeunt. Alarum\\n\\nEnter Macbeth.\\n\\n  Macb. Why should I play the Roman Foole, and dye\\nOn mine owne sword? whiles I see liues, the gashes\\nDo better vpon them.\\nEnter Macduffe.\\n\\n  Macd. Turne Hell-hound, turne\\n\\n   Macb. Of all men else I haue auoyded thee:\\nBut get thee backe, my soule is too much charg'd\\nWith blood of thine already\\n\\n   Macd. I haue no words,\\nMy voice is in my Sword, thou bloodier Villaine\\nThen tearmes can giue thee out.\\n\\nFight: Alarum\\n\\n  Macb. Thou loosest labour\\nAs easie may'st thou the intrenchant Ayre\\nWith thy keene Sword impresse, as make me bleed:\\nLet fall thy blade on vulnerable Crests,\\nI beare a charmed Life, which must not yeeld\\nTo one of woman borne\\n\\n   Macd. Dispaire thy Charme,\\nAnd let the Angell whom thou still hast seru'd\\nTell thee, Macduffe was from his Mothers womb\\nVntimely ript\\n\\n   Macb. Accursed be that tongue that tels mee so;\\nFor it hath Cow'd my better part of man:\\nAnd be these Iugling Fiends no more beleeu'd,\\nThat palter with vs in a double sence,\\nThat keepe the word of promise to our eare,\\nAnd breake it to our hope. Ile not fight with thee\\n\\n   Macd. Then yeeld thee Coward,\\nAnd liue to be the shew, and gaze o'th' time.\\nWee'l haue thee, as our rarer Monsters are\\nPainted vpon a pole, and vnder-writ,\\nHeere may you see the Tyrant\\n\\n   Macb. I will not yeeld\\nTo kisse the ground before young Malcolmes feet,\\nAnd to be baited with the Rabbles curse.\\nThough Byrnane wood be come to Dunsinane,\\nAnd thou oppos'd, being of no woman borne,\\nYet I will try the last. Before my body,\\nI throw my warlike Shield: Lay on Macduffe,\\nAnd damn'd be him, that first cries hold, enough.\\n\\nExeunt. fighting. Alarums.\\n\\nEnter Fighting, and Macbeth slaine.\\n\\nRetreat, and Flourish. Enter with Drumme and Colours, Malcolm,\\nSeyward,\\nRosse, Thanes, & Soldiers.\\n\\n  Mal. I would the Friends we misse, were safe arriu'd\\n\\n   Sey. Some must go off: and yet by these I see,\\nSo great a day as this is cheapely bought\\n\\n   Mal. Macduffe is missing, and your Noble Sonne\\n\\n   Rosse. Your son my Lord, ha's paid a souldiers debt,\\nHe onely liu'd but till he was a man,\\nThe which no sooner had his Prowesse confirm'd\\nIn the vnshrinking station where he fought,\\nBut like a man he dy'de\\n\\n   Sey. Then he is dead?\\n  Rosse. I, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow\\nMust not be measur'd by his worth, for then\\nIt hath no end\\n\\n   Sey. Had he his hurts before?\\n  Rosse. I, on the Front\\n\\n   Sey. Why then, Gods Soldier be he:\\nHad I as many Sonnes, as I haue haires,\\nI would not wish them to a fairer death:\\nAnd so his Knell is knoll'd\\n\\n   Mal. Hee's worth more sorrow,\\nand that Ile spend for him\\n\\n   Sey. He's worth no more,\\nThey say he parted well, and paid his score,\\nAnd so God be with him. Here comes newer comfort.\\nEnter Macduffe, with Macbeths head.\\n\\n  Macd. Haile King, for so thou art.\\nBehold where stands\\nTh' Vsurpers cursed head: the time is free:\\nI see thee compast with thy Kingdomes Pearle,\\nThat speake my salutation in their minds:\\nWhose voyces I desire alowd with mine.\\nHaile King of Scotland\\n\\n   All. Haile King of Scotland.\\n\\nFlourish.\\n\\n  Mal. We shall not spend a large expence of time,\\nBefore we reckon with your seuerall loues,\\nAnd make vs euen with you. My Thanes and Kinsmen\\nHenceforth be Earles, the first that euer Scotland\\nIn such an Honor nam'd: What's more to do,\\nWhich would be planted newly with the time,\\nAs calling home our exil'd Friends abroad,\\nThat fled the Snares of watchfull Tyranny,\\nProducing forth the cruell Ministers\\nOf this dead Butcher, and his Fiend-like Queene;\\nWho (as 'tis thought) by selfe and violent hands,\\nTooke off her life. This, and what need full else\\nThat call's vpon vs, by the Grace of Grace,\\nWe will performe in measure, time, and place:\\nSo thankes to all at once, and to each one,\\nWhom we inuite, to see vs Crown'd at Scone.\\n\\nFlourish. Exeunt Omnes.\\n\\n\\nFINIS. THE TRAGEDIE OF MACBETH.\\n\""
